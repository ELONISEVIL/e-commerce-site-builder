git checkout -b AGI

Step 2: Add AGI-Specific Code
Install TensorFlow:
pip install tensorflow

Create a Python Script: Create a file named agi_model.py with the following content:
Python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Print the model summary
model.summary()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Add a README Section for AGI: Update your README.md to include a section about the AGI branch:
## AGI Branch

This branch focuses on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities. The initial setup includes a simple neural network model using TensorFlow.

Step 3: Push the AGI Branch
Push your changes to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Add AGI branch with initial TensorFlow model"
git push origin AGI
